This extension contains a collection of nodes and improvements created for lora management and general quality of life.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have saved a workflow with the `sn0w ksampler` node, make sure to re-save the workflow before the new comfyui frontend is implemented as the old implementation will corrupt your workflow.

# Get Started

## Install

1. Install [ComfyUi](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).
2. Clone this repo into `custom_nodes`:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sn0w12/ComfyUI-Sn0w-Scripts
    ```
3. Start up ComfyUI.

Alternatively install through [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager).

# Configuration

In the ComfyUI settings, you can modify various settings. Some changes will apply immediately, while others require a refresh to take effect.

## Settings

| Setting      | Options | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Animagine Prompt Style      | True / False | Places "1girl/1boy" at the beginning of your prompts in the "Prompt Combine" node.      |
| Custom Lora Loaders SD...   | Textbox | Allows creation of new LoRa loaders by specifying their name and path.        |
| Custom Textbox Colors   | Textbox | Sets the highlight color for text in textboxes.        |
| Custom Textbox Gradient Highlight   | True / False | Makes the textbox highlighting be a gradient between the first and last color based on the strength of the selection.        |
| Disable Default Characters   | True / False | Disables the loading of the default characters in the "Character Selector" node.        |
| Highlight Favourite Items   | True / False | Highlights favorite LoRas and characters in green.        |
| Logging Level   | Warnings<br>Informational<br>Debug | Sets the severity level of logs that will be printed.        |
| Max Difference in Lora Loading   | 0 - 100 | Specifies the maximum allowable difference between a tag and a LoRa for it to be loaded.        |
| Random Characters from Favourites Only   | True / False | Ensures random characters are selected only from your favorited characters.        |
| Remove Lora Path   | True / False | Removes the path information from loras and only keeps the name.        |
| Sort Characters By   | Alphabetically<br>Series | Sorts characters either alphabetically or  by their series.        |
| Sort Loras By   | Alphabetically<br>Last Changed | Sorts loras either alphabetically or by latest changed.        |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The custom lora loaders require these paths to be in your  `extra_model_paths.yaml` (with your real directories of course). You only need to add the ones you are actively using.

```yaml
loras:
    base_path: D:/Ai/Lora/loras

    loras_15: /1.5 # SD1.5
    loras_xl: /XL # SDXL
    loras_3: /3 # SD3
```

# Major Features

## Lora Management

A major focus for me was making loras more manageable by letting users create their own lora loaders with specific folder paths and automatically loading loras based on tags. This makes browsing through your Loras much easier, though it may limit which Loras you can use depending on your configuration. You can configure custom Lora loaders in the ComfyUI settings with the following format:
```
ExampleName1:Value1
```

To create a Lora stack, add a number to the end:
```
Styles XL:style:2
```
![Custom Lora Loader](./imgs/custom_lora_loader.png)

### Favourite Loras & Characters

The custom Lora loaders and the character selector feature allow you to mark Loras and characters as favorites, placing them at the top of the loaders for easy access. Favorite Loras are accessible across all your custom Lora loaders and the standard Lora loader, although the standard loader does not sort them correctly.

![Favourite Showcase](./imgs/favourite_list.png)

### Sort Loras

There are options to sort your loras either alphabetically or by the latest changed file. You can also remove the path information to keep the loader clean. Do note that if you remove the path information and have two loras with the same filename in different paths it will not be able to differentiate them.

## Text Highlighting

Text in the copy/paste textbox will be highlighted when the text is in parentheses. You can change the colors of the highlighting by changing the `[Sn0w] Custom Textbox Colors` setting, there should be one either rgb `rgb(0, 0, 0)` or hex `#000000` color per line. You can choose to either do the highlighting by the strength of the text or the nested level it is in.

Nesting             |  Strength
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![Textbox](./imgs/textbox_highlighted.png) | ![Textbox](./imgs/textbox_gradient.png)

If you have unclosed parentheses it will be highlighted in red.

![Textbox](./imgs/textbox_highlighted_error.png)

## Custom Schedulers

You can write your own custom scheduler in `src/custom_schedulers` and they will be added as a custom node, just make sure to follow the example in `get_sigmas_sigmoid.py`

### Sigmoid Scheduler

A custom scheduler that generally produces similar quality results as most other schedulers in my testing. However it works very poorly at low steps which may be an issue for some. Mostly written as an example for custom schedulers.

>    </details>

### Lora Tester
> Automatically generates X amount of images with provided loras.
> <details>
>    <summary>ℹ️ <i>See More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - I recommend making lora_info and add_default_generation inputs and using the outputs from the Lora Selector.
>    - Takes normal KSampler input but takes positive and negative inputs as text.
>    - Outputs a batch of images.
>
>    ![Lora Tester](./imgs/lora_tester.png)
>    </details>

## Lora Management

Nodes that handle lora selection, stacking, and loading.

### Load Lora Sn0w
> Normal load lora but can put favourite loras at the top of the list.
> <details>
>    <summary>ℹ️ <i>See More Information</i></summary>
>
>    ![Load Lora](./imgs/load_lora.png)
>    </details>

### Load Lora Folder
> Dynamically applies Lora models based on similarity to a provided prompt.
> <details>
>    <summary>ℹ️ <i>See More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - This node processes a given prompt to identify and apply the most similar Lora models of the tags found in the prompt.
>    - For each part of the prompt, the node calculates a distance between tags and available Lora model filenames. The max distance can be chosen in the settings.
>    - **Example folder input:** `*master_folder, subfolder1:3, -excludefolder, subfolder2`
>        - `*master_folder` specifies all paths must include `master_folder`.
>        - `subfolder1:3` indicates up to 3 models from `subfolder1` can be loaded.
>        - `-excludefolder` ensures any path containing `excludefolder` is ignored.
>        - `subfolder2` loads models from this subfolder without a numeric limit.
>    - Note: You need the loras separated into XL and 1.5 as stated in the `Important Note`.
>    - Note: Loras need to be named very similarly to the tag, with at most 5 characters different. Words in the lora filename can be separated by spaces or underscores.
>
>    ![Load Lora Folder](./imgs/load_lora_folder.png)
>    </details>

### Lora Selector
> Automatically selects X amount of loras between two numbers.
> <details>
>    <summary>ℹ️ <i>See More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - Loras have to be formatted like the default kohya_ss outputs. (lora_name-000001)
>    - Select the first lora.
>    - Select the number of the highest lora you want to test.
>    - Select the amount of loras you want to test.
>    - Outputs list of loras like this: \<lora:name:strength>
>    - Add default generation adds an extra "nothing" at the end of the list, used in Lora Tester to generate an image without the lora.
>
>    ![Lora Selector](./imgs/lora_selector.png)
>    </details>

### Lora Stacker
> Outputs a list of loras for Lora Tester. Does not load any loras by itself.
> <details>
>    <summary>ℹ️ <i>See More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - Basically Lora Selector but manual.
>    - Specifically for the lora testers.
>
>    ![Lora Stacker](./imgs/lora_stacker.png)
>    </details>

## Character and Text Processing
Nodes for selecting and combining character and textual elements.

### Character Selector
> Outputs a character name and prompt.
> <details>
>    <summary>ℹ️ <i>See More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - Loads `characters.json` and outputs prompt based on it.
>    - You can create a file named `custom_characters.json` and add characters there if you want, they will be loaded with all the other characters if you format it like the `characters.json` file.
>    - If `custom_characters.json` has a character with the same name as `characters.json` it will add the custom prompt at the end of the normal one, this can be useful if you have loras that need activation tags.
>
>    ![Character Selector](./imgs/character_selector.png)
>    </details>

### Prompt Combine
> Combines multiple strings with a specified separator and optionally simplifies the result by removing redundant or incompatible tags.
> <details>
>    <summary>ℹ️ <i>See More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - If simplify is enabled, the simplification process identifies and removes redundant tags (e.g., when a tag is fully encompassed by another, more descriptive tag) and tags incompatible with factors such as facing away, covered eyes, etc. Any tags that are in parentheses will not be removed.
